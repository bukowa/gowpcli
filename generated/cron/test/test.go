package test

//Tests the WP Cron spawning system and reports back its status.

type Test struct {
    
}

//This command tests the spawning system by performing the following steps:
//
//* Checks to see if the `DISABLE_WP_CRON` constant is set; errors if true
//because WP-Cron is disabled.
//* Checks to see if the `ALTERNATE_WP_CRON` constant is set; warns if true.
//* Attempts to spawn WP-Cron over HTTP; warns if non 200 response code is
//returned.
//
//## EXAMPLES
//
//    # Cron test runs successfully.
//    $ wp cron test
//    Success: WP-Cron spawning is working as expected.
