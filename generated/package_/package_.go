## INFO
	WP-CLI packages are community-maintained projects built on WP-CLI. They can
	contain WP-CLI commands, but they can also just extend WP-CLI in some way.
	Installable packages are listed in the
	[Package Index](http://wp-cli.org/package-index/).
	Learn how to create your own command from the
	[Commands Cookbook](http://wp-cli.org/docs/commands-cookbook/)
